Hay que escribir un parrafo que resuma los cambios hechos al proyecto ficticio y porque son necesarios.
Documentation update (By Fioretti Nazareno Senior):

This website project has reached its conclusion with the last changes. Mainly focusing on the upload files security. By making this contract with NordVPN, pivigames.com achieves total control over the files that the users upload. The changes made are the following:
- The team pivi no longer has to track the p2p connection between users. This seems necesary given the schedule problems that arise from the monitoring.
- The users are farly more secure on his own consults with the website. This was asked by the community long time ago.
- The connection to the website is 10 times faster given the reliance on a more complete server structure. Something that the community complained about since day one.
- The overall image of the pivi team and accountability of his website improves. This is an issue that the team had since the creation of the company.
- The malware speed detection is 2 times faster. There is an external team in NordVPN dedicated to that until the propietary software is finished. The need for faster services had been urgent on all the company. 
- The experience gained from the contract can give the team a very good insight on how to make low level apps and programs. The team mayority expressed the necesity of learning this kind of things.
