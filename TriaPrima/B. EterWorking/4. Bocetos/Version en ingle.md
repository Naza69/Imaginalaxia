Hello everybody, we are the development team "pivi", all of you are welcome to enjoy a short presentation of our new free videogames download website "pivigames.com". In which over more 700 videogames are gonna be totally available for free. 

The target that we should appeal, in the range of 8 and 40 years, the mayority being men, has been determined by our market research. It is thought for the kind of people who lack specific economic conditions and use alternatives medium for downloading this type of entertainment. 

We are excited to announce its design in this occasion. As you can see, the first thing thats meets the eye, is its simplicity and organization, with a red heading that shows the logo, and has distinct sections that help to categorize the games, based on: the gameplay genre, the graphics and the platform. The website has other download options too! Like emulators, licences and accounts for streaming services.

We will like to talk about the timeline production too! A timeline that has extended over 10 months, 2 for the frontend and 8 for the apis redirections. For the fronted we have used free royalty fonts and images, and for the apis we used REACT.
